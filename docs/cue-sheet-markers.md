# CUE Sheet Track Markers

mStream Velvet can read CUE sheet data from your audio files and display the individual tracks as clickable markers on the seek bar. This lets you jump directly to any chapter or track within a single long audio file (common with DJ mixes, classical recordings, vinyl rips, and compilation FLACs).

---

## What it looks like

When a file has cue point data the seek bar shows small vertical tick marks — one per track entry. Hovering a tick shows the track title and index. Clicking a tick seeks directly to that track's start time.

The ticks appear in both the main player bar and inside the Now Playing modal.

---

## Source formats supported

### 1. Embedded cue sheet (preferred)

Some encoders write the CUE sheet directly into the audio file's tags (e.g., in a `CUESHEET` field of a FLAC file). mStream Velvet uses [music-metadata](https://github.com/borewit/music-metadata) to extract this automatically.

Look for `common.cuesheet` in the parsed metadata — if it contains at least one track with an `INDEX 01` entry, those timestamps are used.

### 2. Sidecar `.cue` file (fallback)

If no embedded cue sheet is found, mStream Velvet looks for a matching `.cue` file in the same directory:

1. First tries `<audio-basename>.cue` — e.g. `my-mix.flac` → `my-mix.cue`
2. If not found, checks whether there is exactly **one** `.cue` file in the directory and uses that.

The sidecar file must contain a `FILE` line that mentions the audio filename (case-insensitive). The standard `TRACK`/`TITLE`/`INDEX 01 MM:SS:FF` format is parsed where `FF` is frames (1/75th of a second).

## Database storage

Cue point data is stored in the `cuepoints` column of the `files` table in `mstream.sqlite`.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NULL` | Not yet checked — will be processed on the next scan |
| `'[]'` | Checked, no cue data found (sentinel — won't be re-checked) |
| `'[{"time":0,"title":"Track 1"}, ...]'` | JSON array of cue point objects |

Each cue point object:
```json
{ "no": 2, "title": "Some Title", "t": 12.4 }
```

- `no` — track number from the CUE sheet (integer)
- `title` — track title from the cue sheet, or `null` if not present
- `t` — seconds from the start of the file (float, rounded to 2 decimal places)

### Existing databases (migration)

If you already have an mStream Velvet database created before this feature was added, the `cuepoints` column is added automatically on first boot via:

```sql
ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN cuepoints TEXT;
```

## How scanning works

Cue detection is built into the incremental scanner using the same **smart patch** pattern as album art (`_needsArt`):

1. **New file** — cue data is extracted during the full `parseMyFile()` pass and stored in `insertEntries()` immediately.
2. **Existing file, `cuepoints IS NULL`** — `get-file` returns `_needsCue: true`. The scanner re-opens just that file, extracts cue data, and POSTs to `update-cue`. No full re-parse needed.
3. **Existing file, `cuepoints` already set** — skipped entirely.

This means a library of 100k+ files is processed gradually across scans with no performance cliff.

## API endpoints

### GET `/api/v1/db/cuepoints`

Returns the cue points for a given file path.

**Query parameters**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `fp` | Yes | The virtual filepath of the track (relative to the vpath root) |

**Success response** — `200 OK`

```json
{ "cuepoints": [
    { "time": 0,     "title": "Track 01 - Intro" },
    { "time": 45.2,  "title": "Track 02 - Main Theme" },
    { "time": 193.8, "title": "Track 03 - Reprise" }
] }
```

Returns `{ "cuepoints": [] }` when no data exists for that file.

**Authentication** — requires a valid `x-access-token` header or cookie (standard mStream Velvet auth).

---

### POST `/api/v1/scanner/update-cue`

Internal — used by the scanner child process only (requires `scanApproved` middleware). Writes cue point data (or the `'[]'` sentinel) back to the database.

```json
{
  "filepath": "12 inches/DJ Mix.flac",
  "vpath": "Music",
  "cuepoints": "[{\"time\":0,\"title\":\"Track 01\"}]"
}
```

---

## Client-side rendering

### `loadCuePoints(filepath)`

Called on every track change (normal play, next/prev, Auto-DJ crossfade handoff, and session restore on page load). Fetches from `/api/v1/db/cuepoints?fp=` and calls `renderCueMarkers()`.

### `renderCueMarkers()`

Builds `<button class="cue-tick">` elements and inserts them into `#cue-markers` (main player) and `#np-cue-markers` (Now Playing modal). Each tick:

- Is positioned as `left: <pct>%` based on `t / duration`
- Shows a tooltip via `data-label` attribute (rendered via CSS `::after` as `"<no>. <title>"`) on hover
- Seeks `audioEl.currentTime` on click using `e.stopPropagation()` to avoid conflicting with the seek bar's own click handler
- Track 1 at `t=0` is excluded by the filter `cp.t > 0` — the very start needs no marker

Markers are cleared and re-rendered on every track change.

## CSS classes

| Class | Element | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `.cue-markers` | Container `<div>` | Absolutely positioned overlay inside `.prog-track` |
| `.cue-tick` | `<button>` | Individual tick mark; 12px wide hit zone |
| `.cue-tick::before` | Pseudo | The visible 4px stem — amber (`rgba(255,190,30,.9)`) in dark mode, purple (`rgba(109,60,230,.8)`) in light mode |
| `.cue-tick::after` | Pseudo | Tooltip bubble shown on hover |

The tick container uses `top: 0; bottom: 0` so ticks are contained entirely within the seek bar rail (currently 6px tall, 8px on hover).

## Limitations & known behaviour

- **First track at time 0** is intentionally excluded from rendering (`cp.t > 0` filter). The very start position needs no marker since playback always begins there.
- **Sentinel `'[]'`** files are never re-checked, even if you later add a sidecar `.cue` file. To force a re-check, set `cuepoints = NULL` for those rows directly in the database, or delete and re-add the file so the scanner treats it as new.
- **Duration must be available** in the `<audio>` element for percentage positions to be calculated correctly. If `audioEl.duration` is `NaN` or `0` on the first render call, the ticks will all pile up at position 0. `renderCueMarkers()` also re-fires on `loadedmetadata` to correct this.
- **Sidecar `.cue` multi-disc sets** are not currently supported — only single-file CUE sheets where the `FILE` line matches the audio file.
