# Technology Choices — The Hows and the Whys

Every external service, library, and binary used in mStream Velvet was a deliberate choice. This document explains what each one does, why it was picked over alternatives, and what the trade-offs are. If you are evaluating this project, auditing its dependencies, or just curious why a particular tool is in the stack — this is the place to look.

---

## FFmpeg

**What it does in mStream Velvet:** Four distinct jobs:

1. **Transcoding** — Re-encodes any audio file on-the-fly to MP3, Opus, or AAC at the bitrate the client requests. This is how a FLAC file on your server plays on a phone with limited bandwidth: the server decodes FLAC and pipes compressed audio directly to the browser.
2. **Waveform generation** — Decodes audio to raw PCM (32-bit floilat, 8000 Hz mono) via a pipe. Server-side JavaScript then computes 600 RMS values with a γ=0.7 perceptual curve and caches the result. This gives the seek bar its waveform display.
3. **Scan error repair** — Re-muxes corrupt FLAC, MP3, and WAV files in-place (stream-copy first, then a full re-encode fallback). Strips broken APEv2 tags and corrupt embedded images. Available from the Admin → Scan Errors panel.
4. **Tag writing** — Rewrites ID3/Vorbis tags (title, artist, album, year, genre) without re-encoding the audio, using FFmpeg's `-metadata` flag with `-c copy`.

**Why FFmpeg and not something else?**

FFmpeg is the most complete open-source media processing toolkit that exists. The realistic alternatives for each task above are:

| Alternative | Why not used |
|---|---|
| Node.js audio decoders (e.g. `node-lame`) | Format coverage is limited; no FLAC, no Opus; unmaintained |
| Web Audio API on the server | Doesn't exist server-side in a useful form |
| GStreamer | Complex pipeline setup; no easy Node.js bindings for streaming |
| sox | No codec coverage for modern formats (Opus, AAC) |

FFmpeg handles every format in the supported list (FLAC, MP3, AAC, Opus, OGG, WAV, AIFF, W64…) with a single statically linked binary, and the `fluent-ffmpeg` wrapper makes it straightforward to pipe from FFmpeg into an HTTP response stream.

The binary is bundled in `bin/ffmpeg/` so users do not need to install it separately.

## LRCLIB — Lyrics

**What it does:** Fetches time-synced LRC lyrics (with millisecond timestamps) or plain-text lyrics for the currently playing track. The lyrics display in the full-screen Lyrics visualizer mode and scroll in sync with the music.

**Why LRCLIB and not Musixmatch, Genius, or others?**

| Service | API key required | Free | Synced (LRC) lyrics | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LRCLIB** | No | Yes, completely | Yes | Community-maintained, open database |
| Musixmatch | Yes | Limited (free tier is restricted) | Yes, but behind paywall | Commercial; lyrics must be attributed; display rules apply |
| Genius | Yes | Yes | No — plain text only | No timestamps; not suitable for sync |
| AZLyrics | No official API | — | No | Scraping violates ToS |
| Netease / QQ Music | China-region services | Yes | Yes | Requires VPN or China account for non-Chinese tracks |

LRCLIB is the only service that is completely free, requires no API key or account, and provides synced LRC lyrics for western music. It is also open-source — anyone can run their own instance or contribute lyrics.

**How the matching works:** A single exact-match call is made to lrclib's `/api/get` endpoint with artist, title, and the track's duration (in seconds). The duration comes from the database (populated at scan time), not the audio element, which may report an imprecise or zero value for freshly-loaded tracks. If the API returns no match, the lookup is simply skipped — no fallback, no fuzzy search. A wrong version of the lyrics (e.g. the 12-inch remix timestamps applied to the radio edit) plays out of sync and is actively misleading, so no result is always preferred over a wrong result.

Results are cached in `save/lyrics/` so each track is only fetched once. Tracks with no duration in the database return `notFound` immediately without making a network request.

## Discogs — Album Art

**What it does:** Fetches cover art for tracks that have no embedded album art. It searches the Discogs database by artist + album name, downloads the cover image, and saves it to `image-cache/` along with two thumbnail sizes.

**Why Discogs and not MusicBrainz, Spotify, or others?**

| Service | API key required | Free | Coverage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Discogs** | Yes (free registration) | Yes | Excellent for physical releases; strong for 7" singles, 12" mixes, rare records | Rate-limited but generous for personal use |
| MusicBrainz Cover Art Archive | No | Yes | Good for mainstream releases | Coverage is thinner for non-mainstream and non-Western music |
| Spotify API | Yes | Yes (limited) | Excellent for modern releases | Terms of service forbid caching images; album art is served from Spotify CDN and must stay there |
| Last.fm images | API key | Yes | Moderate | Being phased down; image API less reliable |
| iTunes / Apple Music | Apple credentials | Limited | Strong for popular music | ToS restrictions on caching and display |

Discogs was chosen because it has the deepest catalogue of any music database for physical releases — especially for dance music, 12" singles, obscure pressings, and vinyl-era content. It is a free API (registration required), and its terms for personal, self-hosted use are permissive. Spotify's images explicitly cannot be cached under their developer ToS, which makes them incompatible with a self-hosted server.

The API key and secret are configured once in the admin panel under External Services → Discogs.

## Last.fm — Scrobbling & Auto-DJ

**What it does:** Two distinct features:

1. **Scrobbling** — Reports played tracks to the user's Last.fm profile after 30 seconds of playback. This updates your listening history and statistics on last.fm.
2. **Similar Artists (Auto-DJ)** — When Auto-DJ is in Similar Artists mode, the server queries `artist.getSimilar` to build a pool of artists related to what is currently playing, then picks tracks from your local library by those artists. This gives the Auto-DJ a contextually aware "radio-style" feel without needing an external service to pick the actual tracks.

**Why Last.fm and not alternatives?**

For scrobbling there is no practical alternative — Last.fm is the de facto standard for music listening history. Most music enthusiasts who care about scrobbling already have a Last.fm account.

For similar-artist data, the alternatives are:

| Service | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Last.fm** `artist.getSimilar` | Free, no token scopes required, large historical dataset |
| Spotify recommendations | Requires OAuth scopes tied to a Spotify account; terms restrict building competing products |
| MusicBrainz | Does not provide similarity data |
| AcousticBrainz | Shut down in 2022 |
| ListenBrainz | Open source alternative to Last.fm, but its similarity API is early-stage |

Last.fm's artist similarity data is mature, well-populated, and requires only a free API key with no user OAuth needed for the lookup step.

## Syncthing — Library Sync (Federation)

**What it does:** The Federation feature lets you sync your music library between two mStream Velvet instances — for example, keeping a home server and a travel laptop in sync. mStream Velvet bundles the Syncthing binary, spawns it as a background process, and exposes a simplified setup UI in the admin panel. The Syncthing web UI is proxied through mStream Velvet so you do not need to open a separate port.

**Why Syncthing and not Dropbox, rsync, or others?**

| Tool | Self-hosted | No cloud | Platform-independent | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Syncthing** | Yes | Yes — peer-to-peer | Yes | Open-source, no accounts, encrypted, battle-tested |
| Dropbox / Google Drive | No | No — cloud middleman | Yes | Files pass through a third-party server; storage costs money; not suitable for multi-hundred-GB libraries |
| rsync | Yes | Yes | Linux/macOS only | No GUI; one-directional; no continuous sync |
| Nextcloud | Yes | Yes | Yes | Heavy; requires a full web stack installation |
| rclone | Yes | Yes | Yes | CLI-only; complex setup for non-technical users |

Syncthing is the only option that is entirely self-hosted, encrypted, peer-to-peer (no files go through any external server), cross-platform, and bundleable as a single binary. The mStream Velvet Federation system automates the Syncthing configuration so users do not need to understand Syncthing at all — it just works from the admin panel.

## Butterchurn / Milkdrop Visualizer

**What it does:** Renders the Milkdrop full-screen music visualizer using WebGL. Milkdrop is a shader-based visualizer with hundreds of community presets that animate in sync with the audio. Butterchurn is a JavaScript port of Winamp's Milkdrop 2 plugin.

**Why Butterchurn?**

Milkdrop has one of the largest and most creative preset libraries of any music visualizer ever made — most of it created by the community over 20+ years. Butterchurn makes this entire history available in a browser tab via WebGL with no plugin required. It is also open-source.

Alternatives like [Leva](https://github.com/Leva-org/leva) or custom GLSL visualizers do not have this preset depth, and building a shader visualizer from scratch would be a significant engineering effort for diminishing returns when Butterchurn already exists.

The preset library is bundled in `webapp/assets/js/lib/` so it works fully offline.

## audioMotion-analyzer — Spectrum Visualizer

**What it does:** Renders a configurable real-time frequency spectrum analyser in the full-screen visualizer. mStream Velvet ships 6 hand-curated presets: Mirror Peaks, LED Dual, Radial, Octave Reflex, Velvet, and Line Stereo.

**Why audioMotion-analyzer and not a custom canvas implementation?**

A basic spectrum analyser with `AnalyserNode.getByteFrequencyData()` and a canvas draw loop is straightforward — several hundred lines of code. But audioMotion-analyzer provides:

- Logarithmic frequency scaling (matches how hearing works)
- Octave-band averaging (smoother, more musical)
- Multiple built-in graph modes (mirror, radial, bars, line)
- High-DPI canvas handling
- Smooth interpolation and configurable decay

Building all of this correctly from scratch (especially the logarithmic binning and anti-aliasing) would be several times the code and testing effort. The library is MIT-licensed, maintained, and adds only ~100 KB to the bundle.

## SQLite (`node:sqlite`)

**What it does:** Stores all music metadata (tracks, artists, albums, ratings, playlists, user settings, waveform presence flags, scrobble history, etc.).

**Why SQLite and not PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB?**

mStream Velvet is a personal self-hosted music server. It is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, a home NAS, or a low-spec VPS — not a managed database tier. SQLite is:

- **Zero-install** — no separate database server process
- **Built into Node.js v22** via the `node:sqlite` module (`DatabaseSync`) — no native addon or third-party driver needed
- **Adequate performance** — WAL mode, a 32 MB page cache, and prepared statements handle even 100,000+ track libraries without event-loop stalls
- **Single file** — the entire database is `mstream.sqlite`; backup = copy one file

PostgreSQL or MySQL would require a running database server, a separate install step, and connection management. For a single-user personal server that holds music metadata, that is unjustified complexity.

LokiJS (in-memory JSON database) is still supported as a legacy fallback for installations that pre-date the SQLite migration, but SQLite is the default and recommended engine.

## Web Audio API — Audio Engine

**What it does:** The entire audio pipeline runs through the browser's native Web Audio API. The signal chain (simplified) is:

```
MediaElementSource
  → AnalyserNode      (visualizer tap)
  → GainNode          (ReplayGain normalisation)
  → 8× BiquadFilter   (equaliser bands)
  → GainNode          (master volume)
  → StereoPannerNode  (stereo balance)
  → GainNode          (per-element, for crossfade)
  → AudioContext.destination
```

**Why build this rather than using an audio library?**

No JavaScript audio library provides gapless playback, crossfade, a full EQ, ReplayGain normalisation, stereo balance, and a visualizer tap — all simultaneously — without browser plugins. The Web Audio API is a browser standard (no library needed) and gives direct access to the audio graph at every point. This makes it possible to:

- Tap the signal before the StereoPannerNode for the visualizer (so balance changes do not skew the spectrum display)
- Apply ReplayGain as a `GainNode` without any perceived volume jump between tracks
- Schedule gapless crossfades using `AudioContext.currentTime` for sample-accurate timing

## Subsonic Protocol

**What it does:** mStream Velvet exposes a Subsonic REST API (version 1.16.1 + Open Subsonic extensions) in addition to its own native API. This lets any Subsonic-compatible mobile app (DSub, Symfonium, Substreamer, Ultrasonic) connect to mStream Velvet as if it were a Subsonic or Navidrome server.

**Why implement Subsonic rather than building a native app?**

Building a polished native mobile app for iOS and Android is a significant ongoing engineering and maintenance effort.The Subsonic protocol is a well-established open standard with many mature, actively maintained third-party clients. By implementing the protocol server-side, mStream Velvet users get the benefit of those clients for free — each with their own UI, caching strategies, offline sync features, and platform-native experiences.

The Open Subsonic extension layer (`openSubsonic: true`) allows newer clients to detect extended capabilities beyond what classic Subsonic defined.

## music-metadata — Tag Parsing

**What it does:** At scan time, reads every audio file and extracts all metadata tags: title, artist, album, year, genre, track number, disc number, ReplayGain values, embedded album art, and CUE sheet data. Supports ID3v1, ID3v2, Vorbis Comments, APEv2, RIFF INFO, and more.

**Why this library?**

`music-metadata` is the best-maintained, most format-comprehensive audio tag parser in the Node.js ecosystem. It is actively maintained by a single dedicated author who responds to issues, handles edge cases from real-world files, and supports every audio container in mStream Velvet's list. Alternatives like `node-id3` cover only MP3/ID3; `taglib-node` requires native compiled bindings; and format hand-rolling would introduce a maintenance burden for every obscure tag variant in real music collections.
