# Audio Analysis & Acoustic Similarity — Design Plan

This document describes the planned feature to add per-track audio analysis to mStream Velvet, enabling acoustically-aware smart playlists and Auto-DJ improvements.

---

## Goal

A user selects a song and the system builds a playlist of up to 200 acoustically similar songs from the library — matching by tempo (BPM), musical key, timbre, and energy level. This is completely separate from Last.fm-based similar artists, which is based on listening history data. This is based purely on the actual audio content.

## What Essentia Can Do For Us

[Essentia](https://essentia.upf.edu) is a C++ music analysis library from the Music Technology Group (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona). [Essentia.js](https://github.com/MTG/essentia.js) is its WebAssembly port, usable in both browsers and Node.js.

Relevant algorithms for our use case (all available in the WASM backend):

| Algorithm | Category | What it gives us |
|---|---|---|
| `RhythmExtractor2013` | Rhythm | BPM + beat positions + confidence |
| `Danceability` | Rhythm | Danceability score 0–3 (higher = more danceable) |
| `KeyExtractor` | Tonal | Key (e.g. "C") + scale ("major"/"minor") + keyStrength |
| `HPCP` | Tonal | Harmonic Pitch Class Profile — 12-dim vector, harmonic fingerprint |
| `MFCC` | Spectral | 13 cepstral coefficients per frame — encode timbral character |
| `SpectralContrast` | Spectral | Spectral contrast bands — distinguishes acoustic vs electronic |
| `LoudnessEBUR128` | Loudness | Integrated loudness, true peak |
| `DynamicComplexity` | Loudness | How dynamic the track is (compression level) |

The WASM backend **cannot decode audio files itself** — it processes raw PCM float arrays. This is fine for us: we already use FFmpeg to decode audio to raw PCM for waveform generation. We can reuse that same pipeline.

## Why Not Use an External Service?

| Service | Notes | Why not |
|---|---|---|
| Spotify Audio Features API | BPM, key, energy, danceability | You cannot fetch features for tracks not in Spotify's catalogue; requires OAuth; your private FLAC library is not indexed by Spotify |
| AcousticBrainz | Similar feature set | **Shut down in 2022** |
| AudD | Recognition + features | Paid; fingerprinting-based, doesn't cover all tracks |
| DIY with Essentia | Full access, runs offline | Our choice |

Essentia runs entirely on your server. No API keys, no network calls, no catalogue coverage problems.

## Essentia.js License

Essentia.js is licensed under **AGPL v3**. For a personal self-hosted server (no distribution), this is fine. If the project ever becomes distributed software, the AGPL requires shipping source code. This is noted as a constraint.

---

## Architecture

### 1. Analysis Script — `src/db/audio-analyzer.mjs`

A standalone Node.js script (same pattern as `scanner.mjs`) that:

1. Loads the Essentia WASM module once
2. Enumerates all tracks in the DB that do **not** yet have a `audio_features` row
3. For each unanalysed track:
   - Decodes audio to raw PCM (22050 Hz, mono) via FFmpeg pipe — same as waveform generation
   - Runs the PCM through Essentia algorithms frame-by-frame
   - Computes aggregate features (mean MFCC, mean HPCP, BPM, key, energy, danceability)
   - Writes a row to `audio_features` table keyed by file `hash`
4. On completion of each batch, reports progress back to the server via a callback (same pattern as scanner)
5. Can be interrupted and resumed at any time — tracks already in `audio_features` are skipped

**Processing rate estimate:** On a modern x86 server, Essentia analysis runs at approximately 5–30× real-time for a full feature set. For a 3-minute song: roughly 10–30 seconds. For 130,000 tracks: roughly 1 week at the low end. This is fine per the requirement.

### 2. Database Schema

New table added via a migration-safe `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS audio_features (
  hash        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  bpm         REAL,
  bpm_confidence REAL,
  key_name    TEXT,           -- e.g. "C"
  key_scale   TEXT,           -- "major" | "minor"
  key_strength REAL,          -- 0..1
  danceability REAL,          -- 0..3
  loudness    REAL,           -- LUFS (EBU R128 integrated)
  dynamic_complexity REAL,
  mfcc_mean   TEXT,           -- JSON array of 13 floats
  hpcp_mean   TEXT,           -- JSON array of 12 floats
  analyzed_at INTEGER         -- Unix timestamp
);
```

**Why store MFCC and HPCP as JSON strings?** SQLite has no native array type. The vectors are small (13 and 12 floats respectively) — serialising as JSON adds ~200 bytes per track and avoids a separate table or blob encoding.

### 3. Similarity Computation

Given a seed track (song A), find the N most similar songs in the library:

**Scoring function** (weighted sum of normalised distances):

```
score = w_bpm   × bpm_score(A, B)
      + w_key   × key_score(A, B)
      + w_mfcc  × cosine_similarity(A.mfcc_mean, B.mfcc_mean)
      + w_hpcp  × cosine_similarity(A.hpcp_mean, B.hpcp_mean)
      + w_dance × (1 - |A.danceability - B.danceability| / 3)
      + w_loud  × (1 - |A.loudness - B.loudness| / 20)   -- capped at 20 LUFS diff

-- Default weights (tunable per user):
w_bpm   = 0.25
w_key   = 0.20
w_mfcc  = 0.30   -- timbre is the strongest "sounds like" signal
w_hpcp  = 0.10
w_dance = 0.10
w_loud  = 0.05
```

**BPM score**: `1 - min(|A.bpm - B.bpm|, |A.bpm - 2×B.bpm|, |2×A.bpm - B.bpm|) / A.bpm`
Half/double tempo is considered compatible (a 120 BPM track fits a 60 BPM playlist).

**Key score**: Based on the Circle of Fifths distance. Same key = 1.0; adjacent key = 0.9; relative major/minor = 0.8; two steps away = 0.5; opposite = 0.0. This implements a lightweight version of the Camelot Wheel concept.

**Cosine similarity**: Standard dot-product / (|A| × |B|). Both MFCC and HPCP vectors are unit-normalised before storage to make this a single dot product at query time.

**Performance on 130K tracks**: Loading all 130K feature rows (~40–80 MB of JSON), deserialising MFCC/HPCP vectors, and computing cosine similarity for each pair takes roughly 2–5 seconds in Node.js. This is acceptable for an on-demand "build playlist" action. For real-time Auto-DJ (needs a result immediately), a pre-built nearest-neighbour index or a faster pre-filter (BPM range + key group) reduces the candidate set to ~100–500 before running the full similarity computation.

### 4. New API Endpoints

```
GET  /api/v1/db/audio-features/:hash
  → { bpm, key_name, key_scale, danceability, loudness, ... }

GET  /api/v1/db/similar?hash=…&limit=200&seed_weight=timbre|rhythm|mixed
  → { songs: [track objects sorted by similarity score, highest first] }

POST /api/v1/admin/audio-analysis/start
  → { jobId }   — starts background analysis job (admin only)

GET  /api/v1/admin/audio-analysis/status
  → { running, analysed, total, percent, currentFile }

POST /api/v1/admin/audio-analysis/stop
  → { stopped: true }
```

### 5. Admin Panel Integration

New "Audio Analysis" card under the admin panel (alongside Discogs, Scan, etc.):

- Shows analysis progress bar: `X / Y tracks analysed (Z%)`
- **Start Analysis** button — starts the background job if not already running
- **Stop** button — interrupts the current run gracefully (it stores progress per track, so resuming picks up where it left off)
- Settings: throttle (concurrent jobs = 1; add inter-track sleep ms for low-power servers)
- Info text: "Analysis processes one track at a time. A library of 130,000 songs may take several days. The server remains fully usable during analysis."

### 6. Player UI Integration

**"Similar Songs" playlist builder (Now Playing modal):**
- New "≈ Build Similar Playlist" button in the Now Playing modal (only visible when the current track has audio features)
- Opens a small options sheet: seed strength radio (timbre / rhythm / mixed), length (50 / 100 / 200), vpath filter pills
- Sends `GET /api/v1/db/similar?hash=…&limit=…` and inserts results into the queue

**Auto-DJ: new "Acoustic" mode:**
- Adds a fourth Auto-DJ mode alongside Random, Similar Artists, Last Played
- Picks the next song based on similarity to the current track
- Uses a lightweight fast path (BPM ± 10% + compatible key pre-filter → full cosine on the ~500 candidate set)

**Song detail display:**
- If `audio_features` row exists, show BPM, key, and danceability below the track title in the Now Playing modal
- Displayed as: `♩ 124 BPM  •  A minor  •  ⚡ 78% danceable`

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — Storage & Backend Core
- [ ] Add `audio_features` table (SQLite + Loki migration)
- [ ] `src/db/audio-analyzer.mjs` — FFmpeg PCM pipe → Essentia WASM feature extraction → DB write
- [ ] `getSimilarSongs(hash, limit)` in sqlite-backend / loki-backend using in-process cosine scoring
- [ ] New API endpoints: `/api/v1/db/similar`, `/api/v1/admin/audio-analysis/*`

### Phase 2 — Admin UI
- [ ] Audio Analysis card in admin panel with progress display and start/stop controls
- [ ] Per-track `analyzed_at` visible in the scan error detail (so you can tell which files were skipped)

### Phase 3 — Player UI
- [ ] "Build Similar Playlist" button + options sheet in Now Playing modal
- [ ] BPM / key / danceability shown in Now Playing modal when features available
- [ ] Auto-DJ: "Acoustic" mode

### Phase 4 — Tuning (optional, post-launch)
- [ ] User-adjustable similarity weighting sliders in player Settings panel
- [ ] Pre-built nearest-neighbour index (ANN) for sub-100ms similar-song lookup at scale
- [ ] Subsonic `getSimilarSongs` endpoint wired to this instead of returning empty

## Technical Constraints & Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Essentia.js WASM build is large (~5–8 MB) | Load once per analyzer run; not loaded in the main server process |
| AGPL license | Personal self-hosted use is fine; document if distributing |
| Essentia.js not actively maintained since 2021 | Pin to last known-working version; WASM builds are self-contained |
| Node.js v22 WASM compatibility | Test before implementing; fallback: port BPM + key algorithms in pure JS (well understood literature) |
| Memory pressure on Raspberry Pi / low-RAM VPS | Process one file at a time; release WASM memory between files |
| Analysis quality for electronic music | MFCC is best for timbre; for pure BPM-based matching, `RhythmExtractor2013` is state-of-the-art |

---

## Fallback: Pure-Node.js Implementation

If Essentia.js WASM is incompatible with Node v22 or proves too heavy, all required features can be implemented in ~600 lines of pure Node.js mathematics (FFT via standard library + typed arrays):

- **BPM**: Autocorrelation of onset strength signal (standard MIR)
- **Key**: Krumhansl-Schmuckler profile correlation against 24 major/minor templates
- **Timbre**: 13-coefficient MFCC from mel-filter-bank → DCT (DCT is in Node.js stdlib via `crypto` / can be written as a 13-line matrix multiply)

This avoids all external dependencies. Decision point: try Essentia.js first; implement pure-JS if it fails.
