## albumsOnly behaviour

When `albumsOnly: true` is set on one or more folders, the Albums view will **only** show albums from those folders. All other folders are excluded from the albums browser (they remain fully accessible for playback, search, and Auto-DJ).

- If **no** folder has `albumsOnly: true`, the Albums view shows everything (original behaviour).
- Flagging a **root** vpath (no parent) includes all files under that root.
- Flagging a **child** vpath includes only the files under its `filepathPrefix` within the parent vpath.
- Multiple child folders from the same parent can all be flagged — they are combined with OR logic (whitelist union).

The flag is propagated to the client via `GET /api/v1/ping` in `vpathMeta[vpath].albumsOnly`.

See [Albums-Only feature documentation](../albums-only.md) for the full user-facing guide.
