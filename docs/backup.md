# Admin Backup

Backups the database and configuration file from the admin panel.

## What is backed up

Each backup is a zip file containing:

- `mstream.sqlite` — the main database (plus `mstream.sqlite-wal` / `mstream.sqlite-shm` if WAL files are present)
- `default.json` — the active configuration file

## Storage location

Backups are stored in `save/backups/` (sibling of `save/db/`).

## Retention

Up to **4 backups** are kept. When a fifth backup is created the oldest is automatically deleted.

## Manual backup

Open the admin panel → **Backup** section → click **Create Backup Now**.

The backup list shows filename, size, creation date, and a **Download** button for each backup.

## Automatic weekly backup

mStream Velvet checks every hour (with a 30-second delay on boot) whether 7 days have elapsed since the last automatic backup. If so, a new backup is created.

The last-run timestamp is stored in `save/backups/.last-weekly`.

## API endpoints

All endpoints require admin authentication (`/api/v1/admin/*` guard).
