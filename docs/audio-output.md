# Audio Output Device Selector

mStream Velvet lets you choose which speaker or audio device your browser routes playback to — without changing the Windows/macOS default device.

The selector lives in **Settings → Playback → Audio Output Device**.

## First-time setup — granting device permission

Browsers require microphone permission before they will reveal individual audio device names. mStream Velvet never uses the microphone — it just needs the permission to list devices.

If the dropdown shows only **Default**, click **Allow devices**:

1. The browser shows a microphone permission dialog
2. Click **Allow**
3. The microphone stream is immediately released — nothing is recorded
4. The dropdown populates with all your audio outputs

This permission is remembered per browser, per site. You only need to do it once.

In **Chrome**, you can also grant it manually:
- Click the lock icon in the address bar → **Microphone** → **Allow**

In **Edge**, the microphone entry only appears in the lock icon *after* the site has requested it — use the **Allow devices** button instead.

## Switching devices

Select any device from the dropdown. The switch is instantaneous — playback continues on the new device without interruption.

The selected device is stored in `localStorage` and restored automatically on the next page load, including across browser sessions.

## Technical notes

- mStream Velvet's player uses the **Web Audio API** (`AudioContext`) for EQ, ReplayGain, and VU meters. Because `audioEl` is connected to a `MediaElementSourceNode`, audio is routed through the `AudioContext` — `HTMLMediaElement.setSinkId()` has no effect. The correct API is `AudioContext.setSinkId()`.
- The stored device preference is applied inside `ensureAudio()` the moment the `AudioContext` is created (first play), so the correct output is used from the very first track even if the page was loaded with no audio playing.
- The `devicechange` event is monitored: if the stored device disconnects, mStream Velvet falls back to the browser default automatically.
