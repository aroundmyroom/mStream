# Anonymous Telemetry

mStream Velvet includes an optional anonymous ping that helps track how many instances are running and which versions are in use. No personal data is ever collected or stored.

---

## What is sent

Once at startup (after a 60-second delay) and then once every 24 hours, mStream Velvet sends this JSON payload to a Cloudflare Worker:

```json
{
  "id": "a3b4c5d6-e7f8-...",
  "version": "5.16.29-velvet",
  "platform": "linux",
  "lastSeen": 1774595289943
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | A random UUID generated once on first boot and stored in `save/conf/instance-id`. Not linked to any user or system identity. |
| `version` | The mStream Velvet version string from `package.json`. |
| `platform` | The result of `os.platform()` — e.g. `linux`, `darwin`, `win32`. |
| `lastSeen` | Unix timestamp (ms) of the ping time, added server-side. |

**Nothing else is collected.** No IP addresses, no usernames, no file paths, no media library contents, no playback history.

---

## Privacy

- The UUID is generated locally (`crypto.randomUUID()`) and is not derived from any hardware ID, username, or network address.
- The UUID is only stored in `save/conf/instance-id`. Deleting this file causes a new UUID to be generated on the next boot.
- The Cloudflare Worker discards the raw IP — only the fields above are persisted.
- Data is stored in a Cloudflare KV namespace. Aggregate counts (total pings, version distribution) are the only meaningful output.

---

## Opting out

Add `"telemetry": false` to your `save/conf/default.json` and restart mStream:

```json
{
  "telemetry": false
}
```

When opt-out is active, `telemetry.js` returns immediately at setup and no pings are ever sent. The instance-id file is not created.

The About page in the admin panel also describes this setting.

## Implementation

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/api/telemetry.js` | UUID management, ping logic, 24 h interval |
| `save/conf/instance-id` | Persisted UUID (one line, plain text) |

The ping uses the native `fetch()` API with a 10-second `AbortSignal.timeout`. Network failures are silently ignored — a failed ping does not cause any error log entries or retries.
